<h1>Named Entity Recognition with spaCy<h1/>

**1. Introduction**

**Problem Statement:** Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to identify and classify named entities in text into predefined categories such as persons, organizations, and locations. This project aims to develop a custom NER pipeline using spaCy, a popular NLP library. The objective is to build a model that can accurately identify and classify entities in text data, optimize the pipeline for efficiency.

**Objectives:**

-   Develop a pipeline for NER using spaCy.
-   Implement and classify named entitie.
-   Optimize the pipeline for efficient entity recognition.

**2.Data Description**

The dataset for this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naseralqaydeh/named-entity-recognition-ner-corpus/). It consists of:

-   **Sentence**: The complete sentence in text format.
-   **POS**: List of Part-of-Speech (POS) tags for each word in the sentence.
-   **Tag**: List of Named Entity Recognition (NER) tags for each word in the sentence.

**Example Data**

-   **Sentence**: "Thousands of demonstrators have marched through London to protest the war in Iraq and demand the withdrawal of British troops from that country."
-   **POS**: ['NNS', 'IN', 'NNS', 'VBP', 'VBN', 'IN', 'NNP', 'TO', 'VB', 'DT', 'NN', 'IN', 'NNP', 'CC', 'VB', 'DT', 'NN', 'IN', 'JJ', 'NNS', 'IN', 'DT', 'NN', '.']
-   **Tag**: ['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-geo', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-geo', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-gpe', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']

**3. Baseline Experiments**

**Goal:** Establish a baseline performance for the NER model using spaCy's pre-trained models and evaluate its effectiveness on the custom dataset.

**Methodology:**

-   Data Preprocessing
-   Loaded the pre-trained English model en_core_web_sm from spaCy.
-   Created and trained an NER component using the custom dataset.
-   Custom NER Model Training, Evaluation, and Visualization of results.

**Results & Conclusion:**

-   The baseline model performance was evaluated, and initial results indicated the effectiveness of spaCy's pre-trained models for the custom dataset, despite that, the model performance might be biased due to data imbalance.
-   Model needs more generalization.
-   These problems were not encountered due to the time limitations.

**4. Methodology breakdown**
